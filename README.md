# Food Sales Predictions
## Using Predictive Machine Learning Models
Author: Jose Flores

## Business problem:
Using data from Big Mart Sales in order to predict item outlet sales.

## Data:
Original data was downloaded from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/.
This dataset has 12 different features and a total of 8523 entries. This problem is related to predictive modeling, and I'll be using the data to make a prediction.

## Methods
I chose to use a simple impuder and encoder instead of dropping rows because of the amount of missing values. 
The data set itself has 8523 entries. The amount of missing values were 1463 for item weight and 2410 for outlet size. 
In percentage values those two represent 17% for weight and 28% for outlet size. 
I beleive that is way too much to drop, so I chose to impute and encode instead. 
I used median imputation because most of the numerical data does not have a normal distribution.
